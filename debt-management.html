    <h1>Debt Management: How to Pay Off Debt</h1>
    <p>Managing debt effectively is essential for financial freedom. Follow these practical steps to pay off your debt faster:</p>

    <h2>1. Create a Budget</h2>
    <p>Start by making a monthly budget that includes all your expenses and income. Identify how much you can allocate toward paying off debt.</p>

    <h2>2. List Your Debts</h2>
    <p>Make a list of all your debts, including the amount owed, interest rates, and minimum payments. Prioritize paying off high-interest debts first.</p>

    <h2>3. Pay More Than the Minimum</h2>
    <p>Whenever possible, pay more than the minimum monthly payment to reduce the principal amount faster.</p>

    <h2>4. Use the Debt Snowball Method</h2>
    <p>Start by paying off your smallest debt first while making minimum payments on larger debts. Once the smallest debt is paid, move to the next one.</p>

    <h2>5. Consolidate Your Debt</h2>
    <p>If you have multiple debts, consider consolidating them into one loan with a lower interest rate.</p>

    <h2>6. Avoid New Debts</h2>
    <p>Stop using credit cards or taking out new loans while working on paying off existing debt.</p>

    <h2>7. Seek Professional Help</h2>
    <p>If you're struggling to manage your debts, reach out to a financial advisor or debt counselor for guidance.</p>
